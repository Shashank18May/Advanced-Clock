# Advanced-Clock


Hello guys,
My name is Shashank Tripathi.
I created the following project
It includes time clock,stopwatch and a countdown timer.


If you want to run this code:-
Just create a new folder with two new files as Main.java and MyFrame.java
and save the code respectively in both files.

This program is compatible with any verion of java above JAVA 1.7.5
